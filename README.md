# **Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark**  
ðŸ“¡ **Detecting Threats & Analyzing PCAPs**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a **network forensics analysis** conducted using **Wireshark**, focusing on investigating **malicious network traffic** related to **Trickbot malware** infections. The analysis showcases skills in **packet inspection, filtering network traffic, identifying exfiltrated credentials, detecting suspicious file transfers, and analyzing malware behavior.** This project was completed as part of an Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures course through the Walker College of Business. 
### **Key Features**  
âœ… **Packet Capture (PCAP) Analysis** â€“ Extracting insights from captured network traffic  
âœ… **Filtering HTTP Requests** â€“ Identifying suspicious POST requests & exfiltrated credentials  
âœ… **Tracing Malware Behavior** â€“ Analyzing Trickbotâ€™s command-and-control (C2) communication  
âœ… **Detecting Data Exfiltration** â€“ Recovering stolen passwords and SSH keys  
âœ… **Investigating Suspicious Files** â€“ Uncovering malware masquerading as PNG files  
âœ… **Hash Analysis** â€“ Using VirusTotal to verify malicious files
